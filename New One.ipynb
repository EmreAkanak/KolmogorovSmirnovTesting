But sometimes analysts divides the target populations. Such as like dividing the geographicaly. As/for an example they divide their targets geographically as New York and San Fransisco and they choose and apply different icon for the same web page on New York with different (bigger/smaller or with different color) icon and in San Fransisco they use different icon at the same time and they compare the results. \n",
